### VnetRoute_properties object
|  Name | Type | Required | Value |
|  ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|  name | string | No | The name of this route. This is only returned by the server and does not need to be set by the client. |
|  startAddress | string | No | The starting address for this route. This may also include a CIDR notation, in which case the end address must not be specified. |
|  endAddress | string | No | The ending address for this route. If the start address is specified in CIDR notation, this must be omitted. |
|  routeType | string | No | The type of route this is:
            DEFAULT - By default, every web app has routes to the local address ranges specified by RFC1918
            INHERITED - Routes inherited from the real Virtual Network routes
            STATIC - Static route set on the web app only

            These values will be used for syncing a Web App's routes with those from a Virtual Network. This operation will clear all DEFAULT and INHERITED routes and replace them
            with new INHERITED routes. |
